# MobileFaceNet

The pre-trained model of a TensorFlow implementation of the MobileFaceNet
model was created by "sirius-ai" and is available in GitHub at
https://github.com/sirius-ai/MobileFaceNet_TF under the Apache 2.0 
license.

It is not straightforward to convert this model to its TensorFlow Lite
version. The scripts used are available in the conversation around the
[How to convert pretrained model to tflite](https://github.com/sirius-ai/MobileFaceNet_TF/issues/46)
project issue in GitHub.

We make this file available as a derived work of the above mentioned model.
